## Swap Widget demo

The Swap Widget bundles the whole Uniswap experience into a single React component that developers can easily embed in their app with one line of code.

This repo is a simple example of how to import the [@uniswap/widgets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/widgets) package and embed the Swap Widget in a web app using either NextJS or the create-react-app framework.

## Getting started

1. First, decide which web framework you want to use: NextJS or create-react-app. The implementation differs slightly, so this repo includes one branch for each framework:
    - [nextjs branch](../../tree/nextjs)
    - [create-react-app branch](../../tree/cra)

2. Download the remote branches by running `git branch -v -a`.

3. Switch to your chosen branch by running `git switch nextjs` or `git switch create-react-app`.

4. If this is your first time downloading the repo, run `yarn install`.

5. Run the app with `yarn start`.
