# Swap Widget demo

The Uniswap Labs [Swap Widget](https://docs.uniswap.org/sdk/widgets/swap-widget) bundles the whole Uniswap experience into a single React component that you can easily embed in your web app with one line of code.

This repo is a simple example of how to import the [@uniswap/widgets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uniswap/widgets) npm package and embed the Swap Widget in a web app using either [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) framework.
